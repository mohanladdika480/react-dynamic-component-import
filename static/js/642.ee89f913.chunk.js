Instead of passing the new state value directly, you pass a function. This function receives the previous state value as an argument, and you return the new state value. This ensures you\'re always working with the most up-to-date state, even if multiple updates are batched together.','<span class="semibold_italic">Lazy Initialization:</span> If the initial state is the result of an expensive computation, you can pass a function to useState. The function will be called only once to set the initial state.
